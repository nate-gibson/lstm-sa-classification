# Summary:
This repo hosts files for our group project for CPT_S 475 (Data Science) at WSU Pullman for Fall 2020.

# Models:
Both models sequential neural networks which perform time series classification.
There are actually two sub-models in each model, one using an LSTM layer and
the other using a Self-Attention layer. The purpose of the models is to compare
the performance in terms of accuracy and speed between LSTM and Self-Attention
for time series classification./
* occupancy - contains occupancy dataset and model 'occupancy_model.py'
* activity - contains activity dataset and model 'activity_model.py'
